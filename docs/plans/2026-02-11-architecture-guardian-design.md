# Productized Offer Design: The Architecture Guardian (Continuity)

## Overview
**The Architecture Guardian** is a recurring subscription service designed to protect the integrity of a high-performance Angular/Nx codebase. It is the natural "next step" for clients who have completed a Signals Spark or Performance Surgery.

## Strategic Positioning
*   **Target Client:** Companies with an internal dev team that needs senior oversight but isn't ready for a $200k/year full-time CTO/Architect.
*   **The Problem:** "Technical Drift." After a consultant leaves, the internal team often reverts to old habits, slowly re-introducing technical debt and slowing down velocity.
*   **The Solution:** An async-first "Guardrail" service that provides elite-level code review and strategic guidance for a fraction of a full-time hire.

## Value Proposition
*   **For the Founder:** Insurance that the codebase remains scalable and the team stays productive.
*   **For the Dev Team:** Access to an expert "second opinion" to resolve architectural debates and avoid "dead-end" technical choices.

## Deliverables

### 1. High-Impact PR Reviews
*   Review of up to 5 mission-critical Pull Requests per week.
*   Focus on: State management patterns, bundle-size impact, and modular boundaries.
*   24-hour async response time.

### 2. Monthly Strategy Sync
*   One 45-minute monthly call to review the roadmap and "pre-architect" upcoming features.

### 3. Priority Slack/Discord Access
*   Direct access for architectural "Quick-Fire" questions and tech-stack vetting.

## Pricing & Guardrails
*   **Investment:** $2,500 / month (Subscription).
*   **Guardrails:** 
    *   No active coding/implementation (Review and Strategy only).
    *   No participation in daily standups or "status" meetings.
    *   Limited to defined "Critical Path" PRs.
